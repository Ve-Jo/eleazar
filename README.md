## Setup Options

### Standalone Setup (RECOMMENDED) based on [THIS COMMIT b7b6abb](https://github.com/Ve-Jo/eleazar/tree/b7b6abb9e1e8e68a8ba0455a5489069d21ad0b6d)

🚧 **Work In Progress**

## Requirements

🚧 **Work In Progress**

## Project Structure

Currently, the latest commit of this project is being split up into three repositories:

- [eleazar](https://github.com/Ve-Jo/eleazar) - Main bot repository
- [eleazar-activities](https://github.com/Ve-Jo/eleazar-activities) - Voice activity repo
- [eleazar-hub](https://github.com/Ve-Jo/eleazar-hub) - Eleazar's hub module (where i migrate all main things for future scaling)

## Development Notes

> **Note:** Most of this code has been AI-generated without specific plans or progression checking, so many things may look "messy" or overcomplicated and could be simplified significantly.

## Project Status

I'm tired of working on this project alone until its release state, so I'm stepping away from making Discord bots and planning to work on something else.

I'm making this project public in case someone on the internet finds it helpful. Maybe together we could potentially finish this amazing project.
