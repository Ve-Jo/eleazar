Currently, latest commit of this project being splitted up into three repositories:
[eleazar](https://github.com/Ve-Jo/eleazar)
[eleazar-activities](https://github.com/Ve-Jo/eleazar-activities)
[eleazar-hub](https://github.com/Ve-Jo/eleazar-hub)

Mostly of these all code is being AI Vibe-coded without specific plans or progression checking, so most things can look "trash" or wrong/overcomplicated and can be simplified.
